This project is something like a personal page when someone could share some things like a personal blog, pictures, recepies, and some "trash".

I've done it to practice more Next, and to have a place where I could put all that things.

This is a completerly WIP, so when it does something I will start versioning it (I'm still figuring out if I'm going to do it more generic or specifically for sharing my things).

So, keep it up!

## Getting Started

`# TODO: update that`

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
